# rendered-country-flags
> Rendered flag emojis for all countries

## Introduction
This module provides a rendered and base64-encoded version of all the emoji flags present in google's Noto Color Emoji font.

## Usage
```js
const icons = require('rendered-country-flags');

console.log(icons["US"]);
// -> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhE..."
```

## Development
```
# Generate files
bash generate.sh
```

If you'd like to generate the flags from source, clone [googlefonts/noto-emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji), patch the `Makefile` in there using `Makefile.patch` and just build the project using the instructions provided in the README.

## License
All the icons used in this package come from the noto emoji font, which is licensed under [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/master/fonts/LICENSE). More concretely, the flag emojis are generated by applying a transform to a set of flag images obtained from either wikipedia (CC BY-SA license) or created by google and exempt of copyright.
